# Introduction

![Introduction Image](/images/posts/2024-01-27.png)

Hello, fellow gamers and developers! Itchson here, back with an exciting little update from the indie game development front. I'm thrilled to share my latest creation, crafted for [PIRATE GAME JAM 14](https://itch.io/jam/pirate), themed "The Spreading": "Color Infection." This arcade/puzzle game is a test of strategy and agility, set against a backdrop of ever-shifting colors.

In "Color Infection," players control a stationary white square at the center of the screen, tasked with battling incoming colored triangles. Each enemy collision infects the player with a new color, granting unique abilities for 6 seconds. The challenge? Avoid incompatible infections while harnessing the powers of color combinations.

- **Red**: Faster shooting.
- **Blue**: A protective shield.
- **Yellow**: Exploding projectiles.
- **Combine colors** like Red + Blue for Purple, unlocking hybrid abilities.

Experience the dynamic gameplay and test your reflexes [here](https://sutajio.itch.io/color-infection).

# Seeking Inspiration: A Journey Awaits

In personal news, I'm planning a couple of weeks of travel from mid-March to search the world for inspiration. My destination is yet to be decided, but I'm excited about the creative spark this journey will bring to my game development. Stay tuned for updates and stories from my travels!

# In Conclusion

"Color Infection" isn't just about survival; it's about mastering the art of color warfare. 
I'm eager to hear your feedback and see how you fare in this colorful battlefield. Your engagement and input are invaluable as I continue this journey in game development.

Until next time, keep exploring, keep developing and gaming!
