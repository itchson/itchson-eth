# Introduction

![Introduction Image](/images/intro_image.png)

Hello, fellow gamers and tech enthusiasts! I'm Itchson, your guide to the future of web3 game development. I'm thrilled to announce the official launch of [itchson.com](https://itchson.com), a platform designed to be a cornerstone in the realm of web3. This website serves as a hub for my portfolio, blog posts, and groundbreaking projects in the web3 game development space.

# Galaxy Royale: Inikokoru

My main indie game development project "Galaxy Royale: Ikinokoru." It's a 2D top-down survival space shooter set in a distant future where humanity is a thing of the past. Players control remote Batorujettos (battle jets), aiming to advance from the academy to explore the universe, battling against the antagonistic Kaiji, a radical group of Kikai.

## Key Features:

- **Genre:** Top-down survival space shooter.
- **Setting:** Post-humanity space era.
- **Gameplay:** Engaging battles, exploration, and mission completions.
- **Player Hub:** Customizable 2-story pagoda in space.
- **Progression:** Earn XP by collecting crystals and completing missions.
- **NFT Integration:** Mintable NFT Batorujettos.
- **Art and Audio:** Anime/manga-inspired art and futuristic soundtracks.

# DALLE3-X-POST

This week, I've created a fascinating project, which I've uploaded to my GitHub ([itchson/dalle3-x-post](https://github.com/itchson/dalle3-x-post)). It's an AWS Lambda Twitter bot that generates images using DALL-E 3 and accompanying text from GPT-4, and posts them to my Twitter every 12 hours. Currently, it's set to generate concept inspiration images about my game. Check out the creations at [x.com/itchson](https://x.com/itchson).

# A Bit About Myself

As a game developer, my biggest passion lies in creating immersive and engaging experiences. When I'm not programming or designing, I'm spending time with Mei, my red-white Siberian Husky, or indulging in my obsession with trading cards. I'd dive deeper into NFTs too, if I had more resources!

# Join Me Live!

Excitingly, I plan to start live streaming my development process and other content across various platforms: [kick.com/itchson](https://kick.com/itchson), [twitch.tv/itchson](https://twitch.tv/itchson), [x.com/itchson](https://x.com/itchson), and [youtube.com/@itchson](https://youtube.com/@itchson). Stay tuned for these sessions, starting in the next few weeks!

I'm eager to bring you all along on this journey. Stay updated by following this blog and my social media channels. Let's embark on this adventure together!

# In Conclusion

The launch of itchson.eth is just the beginning. Stay tuned for regular updates on a plethora of topics ranging from project developments to deep dives into the world of web3. Feel free to comment, share, and engage on my socials as we navigate this exciting technological landscape. Until next time, keep innovating!
